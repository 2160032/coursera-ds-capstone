This application uses natural language processing and analysis to perform text prediction.

A model based on frequency-sorted, filtered and pruned n-grams is pre-constructed and searched dynamically as the user provides input. Results are ranked and candidate predictions are presented.

* **Input** a word or phrase in the text box.
* **Current Word** displays a list of likely completions of the current word.
* **Next Word** displays a list of predictions for the next word.
* **Prediction Parameters** control how many candidate predictions are shown.

[Text Predictor](https://pchuck.shinyapps.io/text-predictor) was developed as a capstone project to complete the Coursera/Johns Hopkins data science series.
